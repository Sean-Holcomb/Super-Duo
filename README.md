# Super-Duo
Project for Udacity Android Developer Nano Degree.
This repository contains two apps, Alexandria and Football(soccer) Scores.
The purpose of this project was to examine starter code, find and fix bugs in the code, 
and add additional features to both apps.
##Alexandria
This allows you to create a collection of your favorite books. After entering in the serial number,
Alexndria searches for the books basic information and displays it. For this app I add a library dependancy
to a bar code scanner so the user does not have to type in the serial code. I also fixed a UX related to typing 
in the serial code and another that related to screen rotation in the same activity.
##Football Scores
This app syncs up with a a football score api to display information about football game in the english leagues.
The task for this app was to create both a widget and a collection widget while making the app more user friendly 
by adding in accessabilty features, like RTL layout support and content descriptions. I also removed hardcoded strings
and organized them in the strings.xml file.
